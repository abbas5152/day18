Q3) What is the difference between List and Set ?
A3) List is index based data structure whereas Set is not depend on index.
    In list we allow to store duplicate values but in Set we can't Store Duplicates.
     List is index based so it follows insertion order but list doesn't follow insertion order.
     In list we can give n number of null value but in Set we can give only one null value.
     List Interface have their personal specific method whereas Set doesn't have any particular method.
